     * Check the [JetBrains docs on how to store raw](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-resources-usage.html#raw-files) files as part of multiplatform project resources.
     *
     * On Android, you can resolve the resource URI using something like:
     *
     * ```kotlin
     *  val uri = Uri.Builder()
                .scheme(ContentResolver.SCHEME_ANDROID_RESOURCE)
                .appendPath("${R.raw.name_of_your_resource}")
